# CleanScan - Ingredient Scanner MVP

A web application that helps users scan ingredient labels on packaged foods and detects harmful substances from a customizable avoid list.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Image Upload & OCR**: Upload photos of ingredient labels for text extraction
- **Ingredient Detection**: Advanced fuzzy matching to find harmful ingredients
- **Severity Classification**: Color-coded risk levels (High üî¥, Medium üü†, Low üü¢)
- **Detailed Information**: Comprehensive details about why each ingredient is harmful

### Avoid List Management
- **Toggle System**: Enable/disable ingredients you want to check for
- **Custom Ingredients**: Add your own ingredients to avoid
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences are saved locally
- **Bulk Management**: Sort by severity and manage large lists efficiently

### Results & Analysis
- **Clear Results**: Green checkmark for safe products, red warning for flagged items
- **Risk Assessment**: Overall risk evaluation with recommendations
- **Ingredient Details**: Tap any detected ingredient for detailed information
- **Source Links**: Credible research links for each ingredient

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with modern design
- **Search**: Fuse.js for fuzzy ingredient matching
- **Storage**: localStorage for user preferences
- **OCR**: Demo mode (production would use Google Cloud Vision API)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CleanScan
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Scanning Products
- Click the "Scanner" tab
- Upload an image by clicking the scan area or dragging & dropping
- Wait for processing (demo uses simulated OCR results)
- View results with detected harmful ingredients

### 2. Managing Your Avoid List
- Click "Avoid List" to see all ingredients
- Toggle ingredients on/off to customize what you want to detect
- Add custom ingredients with the "Add Custom Ingredient" button
- Delete custom ingredients you no longer need

### 3. Understanding Results
- **Green ‚úÖ**: No flagged ingredients found - product is likely safe
- **Red ‚ùå**: High-risk ingredients detected - avoid this product
- **Yellow ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Medium/low-risk ingredients - use caution

### 4. Detailed Information
- Click any detected ingredient to see detailed information
- Learn why it's harmful and view research sources
- See alternative names the ingredient might be listed under

## Default Avoid List

The app comes pre-loaded with harmful ingredients including:

**High Risk (üî¥)**
- BPA and other endocrine disruptors
- PFAS (forever chemicals)
- Sodium nitrates/nitrites
- Azodicarbonamide
- Potassium bromate
- BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)

**Medium Risk (üü†)**
- Artificial food dyes (Red #40, Yellow #5, etc.)
- Caramel coloring
- Sulfites
- BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)
- High fructose corn syrup
- Artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose)

**Low Risk (üü¢)**
- Refined vegetable oils (canola, soybean, corn)
- MSG
- Propylene glycol

## Production Deployment

### Google Cloud Vision API Integration

For production use, replace the demo OCR with Google Cloud Vision API:

1. Get a Google Cloud Vision API key
2. Update `src/components/IngredientScanner.jsx` to use `googleCloudVisionOCR`
3. Set your API key in environment variables

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Customization

### Adding New Ingredients

1. **Via UI**: Use the "Add Custom Ingredient" feature
2. **Via Code**: Edit `src/data/avoidList.json`

### Modifying Severity Levels

Edit the severity field in the ingredient data:
- `"High"` - Red warning, strong avoidance recommendation
- `"Medium"` - Orange warning, caution recommendation  
- `"Low"` - Yellow warning, awareness recommendation

### Styling Customization

Modify `src/index.css` to change:
- Color scheme
- Typography
- Layout and spacing
- Component styling
